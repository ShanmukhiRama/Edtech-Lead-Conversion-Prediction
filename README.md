# Edtech-Lead-Conversion-Prediction overview
Over the past decade, the EdTech industry has exploded worldwide. In fact, the global online education market is projected to reach $286.62 billion by 2023, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.26 percent from 2018 to 2023. Driven by features like seamless information sharing, personalized learning paths, and transparent assessments, platforms such as ExtraaLearn, Coursera, and Udemy are rapidly eclipsing traditional classroom models.

The COVID‑19 pandemic only accelerated this shift. As more learners turned online, a wave of new EdTech startups and established players alike raced to capture attention. With digital marketing tools at their fingertips, these companies generate thousands of “leads” every day—that is, prospective students who show initial interest. Leads typically arise when:

A visitor engages with an ad or post on social media

A prospect browses the website or mobile app and downloads a program brochure

An individual emails or chats to request more information

From there, sales and support teams at ExtraaLearn, Coursera, and others nurture each lead—via follow‑up calls, personalized emails, and targeted content—with the goal of converting them into paying customers.
